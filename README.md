# smaple-python-program
small, WIP python prog. Allows to create a building with x floors and y rental spaces per floor.
You can view the building layout, which will show you which spaces are occupied [1] and which
ones are not [0].  You can add clients, list clients in alphabetical order with their location
in the building. You can remove clients as well. This removes them from the client list and makes
their space available again for rent.
